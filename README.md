# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
I use an existing code to refractor the code to improve it without changing the accessibility of the website. I followed the semantic sequential structure of HTMl. The image structures include alt attributes. In this homework I learned elements, versus classes, and IDs. How to use the correct ones on CSS to modify it. Used Visual Studio Code 



## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
